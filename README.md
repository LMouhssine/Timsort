# Advanced Timsort Implementation in Python

This repository contains an efficient implementation of the Timsort algorithm in Python. Timsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data.

## Features

- Efficient implementation of Timsort
- Demonstrates advanced Python concepts
- Includes example usage and performance testing

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/LMouhssine/Timsort
cd Timsort
```

## Usage

To use the Timsort implementation in your project, import the `timsort` function from `timsort.py`:

```python
from timsort import timsort

# Example usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_arr = timsort(arr)
print(sorted_arr)
```

## Performance

Timsort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst and average cases, and O(n) in the best case. It is designed to take advantage of partial ordering in the input data, making it particularly efficient for real-world datasets.
